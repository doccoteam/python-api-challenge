Homework assignment for UC Irvine Data Analytics Bootcamp

The Python code randomly selects a group of 500+ cities across the world.
Then, the code collects data from the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representatitve model of weather across world cities. The API data is used to graph the following relationships:
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

From the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:
1. Temperature seems to have a clear correlation with latitude
As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude). The southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year (summertime) than the northern hemisphere (wintertime).
2. There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. However, it is interesting to see that a strong band of cities near 0, 80, and 100% cloudiness
3. There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. However, it's more windy in northern hemisphere.
Wind speed tends to generally be betweeen 0 and 20 mph regardless of latitude
4. There is no strong relationship between latitude and humidity. However, cities are more frequent with high humidity (above 70% humidity)
